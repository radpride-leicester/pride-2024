# No Pigs At Pride
‘The First Pride Was a Riot’ is something you may have heard thrown around, and with good reason. The Stonewall Riots, which modern Pride evolved from, came about when police raided the Stonewall Inn - a straw that broketh the camel’s back after centuries of queerphobic state violence. 

The police serve the state and the rich who run it first and foremost, making them a bastion of division and hate. Whether it’s the murder of women like Sarah Everard, mass brutality against black people (and BLM protestors), or continued crackdowns on Palestine protestors, ecological defenders, and trans people fighting for their rights, the police can’t be trusted; they only serve to quell the radical spirit that those who came before us fought for. 

# Protest, Not Pinkwashing
The dilution of radical energy, of a demand for both social and economic justice, is furthered by all the corporations that have clawed away at Pride over the years. In Leicester, the event has become a glorified advertisement for companies like Barratt Homes, Sytner Group, Dunelm and more. These corporate sponsors demolish the potential for a radical event that gets things done. 

# NO PRIDE ON A DEAD PLANET
Most egregious of all is the inclusion of Shell. Shell is killing the planet faster than most, and their fairweather allegiance is not worth the damage they’ve done to not only queers, but everyone on Earth.

Keeping Shell company are Centrica (the owners of British Gas) and Octopus Energy. Both companies engage in shady government lobbying practices in order to profit off the so-called cost of living crisis while millions of us are unable to afford heating through the winter. In 2015, Centrica used its lobbying power to try to force fracking in the UK and to seek harsher criminal sentences for anti-fracking protestors.

# NO PRIDE IN GENOCIDE!
New on the Leicester Pride sponsors list this year are renowned evil multinational corporation PepsiCo: they're the parent company of SodaStream and owner of half of Sabra hummus - both products are currently under boycott for their complicity in apartheid through the illegal displacement of Palestinians. PepsiCo don't stop at complicity in the genocide of Palestinian people, however: their environmental record is also crap. They've come under fire for decades over their water use, energy use, plastic waste, violation of pesticide regulations, and contributions to deforestation and human rights abuses in the palm oil industry.

As radical queers, we stand in opposition to everything PepsiCo represents: queers say free Palestine! Queers say end ecological destruction! Queers say liberation for all!

# Labour: A Dead End For Queers
No organisation has more of an interest in Pride losing its radical edge than the Labour Party. Wes Streeting’s war on trans youth is only the tip of the iceberg, as Keir Starmer would rather attack socialists than rid the party of TERF Rosie Duffield. 

Indeed, Labour has a long history of queerphobia. The party’s first openly Lesbian MP, Maureen Colquhoun, was abandoned to the wolves – a process repeated again when leader Neil Kinnock threw slurs at Peter Tatchell in the 80s.

Queer people have no need to tie ourselves to a party looking to ditch us at the first sign of trouble. The rights we have today were won by our struggle, not that of some paid-off politicians.

# NONE OF US ARE FREE UNTIL ALL OF US ARE FREE
​​​​​​​The cost of living crisis has led to a reduction in welfare for families across the globe, including here in Britain. Instead of solving the problem, our leaders (and the rich few who puppeteer them) stoke hate. They distract us with nonsensical anti-trans rhetoric, attacks on women's autonomy, and the scapegoating of immigrants. This has sparked not only deadly legislation, but a new rise in support for the fascist EDL, one backed by a new far-right block in parliament. 

However, when we all come together, the fascists don't stand a chance. Hundreds in Leicester alone came together to outnumber and outmatch the EDL's attempt to intimidate our city. When another day of violence was planned for the country, thousands of counter protestors took to the streets all over Britain. That is why we must unite the cause of queer liberation to that of liberation for all the oppressed - for only united can we thwart the onslaughts of fascists and oligarchs. 

**No to Fascism!**

**No to Corporate Greed!**

**Yes to queer liberation!**

**Yes to a Radical Pride!**
